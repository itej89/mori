"""Launch-geometry tuning for the HIP/JIT EP kernels — separate from FlyDSL's.

Different kernels, different optima, so never borrow FlyDSL's schedule. This module
does not import ``tuning_configs``; it shares only ``mori.ops.utils`` for device
detection.

Dispatch and combine get INDEPENDENT tables: dispatch depends on the dtype it
transports, combine does not (it only ever reduces the bf16/fp32 staging region).
Both are keyed by (world_size, hidden_dim, topk, experts_per_rank); an
``experts_per_rank`` of None is a wildcard, used only where a sweep showed the expert
count does not move the optimum. A bucket is (max_tok_inclusive | None, block, warp),
ascending, and ``lookup`` merges the two into the op's
(max_tok, disp_block, disp_warp, comb_block, comb_warp) schedule.

An unswept shape returns schedule=None and the single-shot default below. Add one by
sweeping with ``bench_ep.py``. fp32 combine is untuned and takes the bf16 buckets.

dtype keys are whatever ``EpDispatchCombineConfig.dtype_str`` produces, hence
"fp4_disp_bf16_comb": hip rejects an fp4 combine outright, so an fp4 dispatch here is
always paired with bf16 -- which is the configuration the sweep measured.
