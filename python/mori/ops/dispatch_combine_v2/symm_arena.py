"""One cco symmetric window carved into named sub-regions.

Backend-agnostic on purpose: the FlyDSL op and the C++/JIT op take offsets from
the same arena, so a kernel from either can read a peer's region. Kept out of
``flydsl_backend`` because that module imports flydsl at top level and the
C++ backend must not depend on it.
