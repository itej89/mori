"""Register mori as a torch SymmetricMemory backend. Requires **torch >= 2.9**.

Self-contained: plain HIP VMM, no shmem or cco allocator involved, so no mori bootstrap
is needed -- torch's process group is the only rendezvous::

    import torch.distributed._symmetric_memory as symm_mem
    from mori.allocator import register_symm_backend

    symm_mem.set_backend("MORI")   # importing mori.allocator registers it

    t   = symm_mem.empty(1024, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device=device)
    hdl = symm_mem.rendezvous(t, group_name)
    peer = hdl.get_buffer(1, (1024,), torch.bfloat16)

Peers are exposed the way torch's model expects, as the ``buffer_ptrs`` /
``buffer_ptrs_dev`` array -- one base address per rank, same as every other backend.

Internally the ranks are mapped into one flat span, so those pointers happen to be evenly
strided (``buffer_ptrs[r] == buffer_ptrs[0] + r*stride``). That is deliberately not public
yet: exposing it belongs with mori's cco window, whose ``ccoWindowDevice`` already defines
the layout (``winBase``, 4 GiB-quantised ``stride4G``, LSA-rank indexing). See ROCm/mori#557
for the staged plan.

The handle type is probed per device: fabric where supported, POSIX fd otherwise. gfx9
(MI300/MI355) has no fabric support -- ``hipMemCreate`` itself reports "operation not
supported" -- so those fall back to fd, which needs no configuration.

``barrier``/``put_signal``/``wait_signal`` are not implemented and raise, so no signal
pad is reserved in the window -- torch's 9216-byte pad would cost a whole extra 2 MiB page
on a page-aligned allocation. Build with ``MORI_SYMM_SIGNAL_PAD=ON`` to reserve it, and
check ``signal_pad_supported()`` at run time. torch's own ``symm_mem`` collectives
synchronise through the pad, so they need that build; ``dist.barrier()`` is the stand-in
without it.

``rendezvous()`` takes the tensor's *storage* base, so ``get_offset()`` is 0 by
construction: every ``alloc()`` is its own VMM allocation. Handing it a view
(``rendezvous(t[512:])``) therefore describes the whole storage, and ``get_remote_tensor``
answers for the storage base -- pass ``storage_offset`` to ``get_buffer`` to address a
slice. That is torch's model, not something this backend narrows.

The extension is optional and its ABI tracks the installed torch, so it is a plugin:
``pip install`` prebuilds it when it can (``BUILD_TORCH_SYMM=AUTO``, the default; ``ON``
makes a failure fatal, ``OFF`` skips it), and a build that did not happen or no longer
loads is compiled here on first import from the sources shipped in ``_jit-sources``. So
switching torch does not require reinstalling mori. ``MORI_SYMM_FORCE_JIT=1`` ignores the
prebuilt module, which is also how ``MORI_SYMM_SIGNAL_PAD=ON`` can be turned on without
rebuilding mori itself.
