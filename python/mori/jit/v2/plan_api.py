"""ctypes binding for the JIT v2 plan_api C ABI (``mori_jit_*``, libmori_jit.so).

The Python side of the C++ JIT v2 framework (``include/mori/jit`` + ``src/jit``).
It is the counterpart of ``src/jit/plan_api.cpp``, and it is **op-agnostic**:

  * ``load_library(name)`` dlopens an op-library (e.g. ``libmori_ops_v2.so``) so
    its kernels register into the one shared registry that lives in libmori_jit.
  * ``registered_plans()`` lists what has registered.
  * ``make_plan(kernel)`` builds a Plan class for any registered kernel, generated
    entirely from the two schemas C++ publishes -- the REQUEST schema (constructor
    params, defaults, types) and the ARGS schema (launch params + struct layout,
    whose size is asserted against C++'s own sizeof). There is nothing per-kernel
    in this file: ``make_plan("ep_dispatch")`` works the moment that kernel
    registers, with no edit here.

An EP-specific shim (``mori/ops/dispatch_combine_v2/ep_plans.py``) is what knows
to load libmori_ops_v2.so; this module knows only how to talk to the ABI.

Not pybind11 and not the CPython C API: the boundary carries only pointers and
scalars, so there is nothing for a type-conversion layer to do, and ctypes costs
no build step and no compiled artifact. mori already binds libamdhip64 this way
(``mori.jit.hip_driver``). See docs/MORI_JIT_V2_DESIGN.md §6.
