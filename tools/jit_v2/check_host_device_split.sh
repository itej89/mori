# The property: every header the HOST includes must compile with a plain C++
# compiler. Violating it does not break the build immediately -- it quietly drags
# the host into hipcc, and mori's "pip install needs no hipcc" promise dies with
# no error message. Hence a test rather than a convention.

#   1. compiles standalone under g++ -std=c++17 and -std=c++20
#   2. contains no HIP include
#   3. contains no __host__/__device__/__global__ attribute
