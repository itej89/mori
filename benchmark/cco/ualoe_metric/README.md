# Link metrics between two GPUs

Two questions about the link, answered by the two tools here:

| tool | question |
|---|---|
| `ualoe_bw.cpp` | how much of a GPU it costs to *saturate* the link, and at what transfer size that is worth paying |
| `ualoe_latency.cpp` | what *one* crossing costs, with nothing else in flight |

Most of this document is about the first; the second is at the end under
[One-operation latency](#one-operation-latency).

## Copy bandwidth: TDM vs CU

How much of a GPU it costs to saturate one link, and at what transfer size that cost is worth
paying.

The question is not "which transport is faster" -- at a full grid and a large payload they land
within 0.1% of each other, both at the link ceiling. It is **how much of the GPU each one has to
occupy to get there**, because whatever is left over is what a fused kernel can use for compute.

Two sweeps answer that, both built from `ualoe_bw.cpp`, which copies a payload to a peer GPU over
xGMI and reports one-way GB/s measured on the pushing side:

| sweep | script | axis | build |
|---|---|---|---|
| block sweep | `tools/blksweep.sh` | grid width, at a fixed 16 GB payload | `-DSWEEP_16 -DBLKONLY` |
| size x width matrix | `tools/uamatrix.sh` | transfer size x grid width | `-DSWEEP_MATRIX`, `MATRIX=1` |

Transports compared:

| kind | name | how it moves data |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `copyk` | CU vector copy, `uint4` loads and stores, every thread in the block moves data |
| 1 | `tdm_write` | TDM (tensor DMA) descriptors, staged through LDS; one issuing wave per block |
| 8 | `tdm_store_cuload` | CU-staged: vector loads into LDS, TDM stores out |
| 9 | `tdmmws` | staged multi-issuer, `MWSISS` issuing waves per block |

The block is deliberately *not* normalised into equivalent hardware. The CU kernel runs 512 threads
per block all moving data; the TDM kernel runs 256 threads per block of which two waves issue
descriptors and the rest wait on a barrier. That asymmetry is the result, not a confound.

## Block sweep: how wide a grid each transport needs

16 GB payload, both transports at the same block count. Full data in
[`results/blksweep_16gb_gfx1250.csv`](results/blksweep_16gb_gfx1250.csv) (two rounds).

| blocks | CU | TDM | TDM as % of its own ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | 337 | 999 | 61% |
| 256 | 666 | 1582 | 96% |
| 512 | 1283 | 1641 | 99.7% |
| 2048 | 1591 | 1643 | 99.8% |
| 8192 | 1632 | 1645 | 100% |
| 16384 | 1639 | 1646 | 100% |

Both reach ~1640 GB/s, but TDM is there at 512 blocks while CU needs 8192 to come within 1% of the
same number -- a factor of 16 in grid width. In the linear region a TDM block is worth about
7.9 GB/s against 2.6 GB/s for a CU block, bought with two issuing waves instead of sixteen full ones.

`TDMms` tracks `TDM` closely and leads it slightly below 256 blocks. `TDMc2` ramps slowest because
its loads go down the vector path, and only catches up past 512 blocks.

## Matrix: where the transfer size makes that cost worth paying

Transfer size x grid width, `CUMUL=64` / `TDMMUL=32`, so a point on the axis launches **64 CU blocks
against 32 TDM blocks** -- the TDM side is running half the grid. Full data in
[`results/uamatrix_gfx1250.csv`](results/uamatrix_gfx1250.csv), 189 cells, both transports, with each
side's launched block count in its own columns rather than in a footnote.

At 8 GB, comparing the two at the same point on the axis (TDM on half the blocks):

| axis | CU blocks / TDM blocks | CU | TDM |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 64 / 32 | 170 | 256 |
| 8 | 512 / 256 | 1282 | 1577 |
| 16 | 1024 / 512 | 1474 | 1636 |
| 64 | 4096 / 2048 | 1630 | 1637 |
| 256 | 16384 / 8192 | 1641 | 1641 |

Below about 1 MB neither transport is grid-limited -- widening the grid changes nothing and the two
sit within 30% of each other, TDM ahead at 1 MB (182 vs 195 GB/s at the wide end, where CU is
actually the faster of the two). Above 16 MB the picture is the one the block sweep shows: TDM is at
the ceiling on half the blocks.

## Tile size: what decides how many blocks can participate

A compiled-in tile also decides how much of the grid has anything to do. The payload is cut into
`bytes/tile` tiles, an issuing wave takes `MWSPIPE` of them per round, so a launch can only occupy
`bytes/(tile*MWSISS*MWSPIPE)` blocks no matter how wide it is. At 1 MB and an 8 KB tile that is
8 blocks, which is exactly where the 1 MB row stops responding to the grid.

`DYNTILE=1` sizes the tile per cell instead: `clamp(bytes/(blocks*MWSISS*MWSPIPE), DYNMIN, tile)`,
rounded down to a power of two. Six matrices over the same SIZE x BLOCK axes are in
[`results/tilegeom_gfx1250.csv`](results/tilegeom_gfx1250.csv), 540 cells: the single-issuer baseline
plus five multi-issuer configurations, all in one batch with identical build flags, because the tables
from earlier batches do not subtract against these -- one of them reads exactly 2x on the same cell.
The same file carries the 512-block extension and the issuer-count sweep both described below.

The tile comparison below holds MWSISS at 8 and MWSPIPE at 2, which is 128 KB per block per round. The
next section shows that number is itself the main knob, and that halving it to 64 KB is worth another
4.8% at a wide grid.

Against that baseline, at 8 GB, dynamic sizing with 8 issuing waves is worth a flat **2.1x from 1 to 64
blocks** (8.3 -> 17.9 at one block, 506 -> 1061 at 64), +56% at 128, and nothing at 256, where both are
at the link ceiling and the baseline is 1.3% ahead (1579 vs 1559). The ceiling was never the thing that
moved; what moved is how few blocks are needed to reach it.

The two changes have to ship together. Eight issuing waves on a *fixed* tile is a regression at mid
sizes -- 1 MB at 256 blocks is 89 GB/s against the baseline's 181 -- because a block consumes
MWSISS*MWSPIPE = 16 tiles per round, so 1 MB feeds 8 blocks, while the single-issuer kernel takes 4 and
feeds 32. Dynamic sizing brings it to 189.

At 256 blocks, across tile policies:

| payload | fixed 8 KB | dynamic, cap 8 KB | fixed 16 KB | dynamic, cap 16 KB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 256 KB | 23.0 | **50.4** | 14.3 | 51.2 |
| 1 MB | 89.3 | **189.3** | 55.3 | 189.7 |
| 4 MB | 337 | **546** | 217 | 548 |
| 16 MB | 895 | **1010** | 794 | 1034 |
| 64 MB | 1318 | **1318** | 1201 | 1200 |
| 256 MB | 1474 | **1476** | 1405 | 1402 |
| 8 GB | 1559 | **1559** | 1602 | 1601 |

Dynamic sizing at an 8 KB cap is the one to use: it doubles 256 KB and 1 MB, gains 62% at 4 MB and
13% at 16 MB, and gives up nothing anywhere, at the same 128 KB of LDS. The build differs from the
fixed-8 KB one only by the switch, so that pair isolates the sizing itself.

A 16 KB tile is not worth its LDS. It costs 9% at 64 MB and 5% at 256 MB -- the sizing formula lands
exactly on 16 KB there -- and only pays above 4 GB, by 2.7%, for twice the LDS and one block per CU.

### The ceiling is set by bytes per block per round, not by the issuer count

Both configurations were also run out to 512 blocks and up to a 16 GB payload, which is the payload
the block sweep uses -- that sweep is this row, measured on its own. The baseline column reproduces it
to within 0.2% at every shared point (999 / 1582 / 1641 against 998.7 / 1580.2 / 1641.7 at 128 / 256 /
512 blocks), which is also the evidence that the two harnesses are comparable despite the different
iteration counts.

At 512 blocks the eight-issuer configuration flattens at ~1570 while the baseline climbs past it to
1642, which reads as a ceiling on multi-issue. It is not. Sweeping issuer count, pipe depth and tile at
16 GB / 512 blocks, one block per CU, sorted by what a block pushes out per round -- MWSISS * MWSPIPE *
tile, which is also its LDS:

| per block per round | configuration | 16 GB @ 512 blocks |
|---|---|---|
| 32 KB | baseline, 1 wave x 4 x 8 KB | 1642 |
| 32 KB | 2 waves x 2 x 8 KB | 1642 |
| **64 KB** | 4 waves x 2 x 8 KB | **1645** |
| **64 KB** | **8 waves x 1 x 8 KB** | **1645** |
| 128 KB | 8 waves x 2 x 8 KB | 1570 |
| 128 KB | 4 waves x 2 x 16 KB | 1568 |
| 256 KB | 8 waves x 2 x 16 KB | 1632 |

The two 128 KB rows have different issuer counts and different tiles and land 0.1% apart, and one of
them issues the same 8 descriptors per round as the 1645 row above it. Neither issuer count nor
descriptor count separates these; the round size does. 64 KB is the optimum, 128 KB costs 4.6%, and a
16 KB tile only "rescues" eight issuers by pushing them from 128 KB over that dip to 256 KB -- 1632,
still short of 64 KB's 1645, for twice the LDS and 8% at 64 MB.

So issuer count and tile size are two factors of one number, and it is the number that matters.

**Use 8 issuing waves with MWSPIPE=1 on an 8 KB tile.** It is at or within 0.1% of the best measured
value at every point on the axis: 17.98 GB/s at one block against the baseline's 8.3, 1063 at 64
blocks, 1613 at 128 where the baseline needs 512 to match, and 1645.2 at 512 -- the highest number in
the file and the same 1645 the block sweep gets at a full grid. It also wins the mid sizes outright:
64 MB reads 1412 / 1404 / 1371 at 128 / 256 / 512 blocks, 3% over 4 waves x 2 and 6-8% over 8 waves x 2.
LDS is 64 KB per block, half of what the eight-issuer configuration used to ask for.

Payload does not enter into the issuer choice -- at 1 MB every multi-issuer configuration reads ~190
regardless -- because what matters there is the tile being divided evenly, not who issues it.

Why 64 KB and not 128 is not established here. Whatever it is is not the descriptor rate, which the two
128 KB rows rule out, and it is not occupancy, since these all run one block per CU well inside the
320 KB budget.

The floor stays at one row. Dropping it to 256 B, which makes the descriptor narrow its row rather
than drop rows, lets 256 KB reach 64 blocks instead of 16 and changes the bandwidth by nothing
(50.35 vs 50.37). Everything at or below ~256 KB is bounded by per-transfer fixed cost, not by tile
granularity: 64 KB at 13 GB/s is 4.9 us, which is the same order as the launch cost this path pays.
Small messages get faster by being batched into fewer launches, not by being cut differently.

## Reproduction

Both tables were re-measured on 2026-08-12 against the earlier runs, on an idle f01-2, after a
`VECADD` health check.

- Block sweep vs the 7/31 run: every point within 0.2% except 256 blocks (0.85%), which sits exactly
  on the knee where the curve is steepest.
- Matrix vs the recorded TDM table: 189 of 189 cells within 3%, worst -2.95% at 16 MB / axis 8, the
  large majority within 1%.

A single re-run cannot separate run-to-run drift from a systematic shift, so the small biases visible
in the matrix comparison (the axis-8 column reads ~1.5% low, the 64-256 MB cells at wide grids ~1-2%
high) are not attributed to anything here.

Routing both scripts through `tools/build_ualoe.sh` added `-D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` and
`-DHIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS` to a build that had neither, so everything above was measured again on
that path:

- Block sweep, TDM column: mean -0.00%, nothing over 3%.
- Matrix, TDM column: mean -0.09%. Five CU-column cells read 3.3-4.9% high, all on one axis; the TDM
  column at the same cells does not move.
- Recommended build (8 issuers, one tile deep, even split), at 16 GB against the pre-unification run:
  17.985 / 138.305 / 1063.259 / 1612.436 / 1644.482 at 1 / 8 / 64 / 128 / 512 blocks, the largest gap
  0.07%. The gain over the single issuer survives intact: 2.1x from 1 to 64 blocks, 1.61x at 128.

The two added `-D`s do not reach the device code. Disassembling the code object out of each fatbin gives
3697 identical lines; the 210 differing bytes sit in ELF notes at fatbin offsets 36089 and 67365, and
`.text` is unchanged. So the five CU cells are node state, not the flags -- the same wide-grid cells were
already running 1-2% high in the comparison above, before any of this.

## Running it

```bash
# On a node whose GPUs are idle. Both ranks are local (GPU 0 -> GPU 1) over a socket on 127.0.0.1.
bash tools/blksweep.sh
bash tools/uamatrix.sh
```

With no arguments the matrix is 1KB doubling to 8GB against 1..512 blocks, 240 cells, roughly 15
minutes.

Both refuse to start if a previous run is still alive or if the LDS preflight fails. Knobs:
`GRID`, `BASEX`, `GPUA`/`GPUB` or `GSRC`/`GDST`, `ARCH`; plus `ROUNDS`/`BLKS` for the block sweep and
`CUS`/`SZS`/`CUMUL`/`TDMMUL`/`BUDGET`/`MAXB` for the matrix. `PREFLIGHT_ONLY=1` stops after the check.

**The defaults are the 8-issuer even-split configuration**, so the commands above already measure it:
`MWSISS=8` waves per block each issuing, `MWSPIPE=1` tile deep, `MWSSPAN=8192` per wave, the TDM column
pointed at `tdmmws` (`MATRIX_TDMKIND=9`) and its tile sized per cell (`MATRIX_DYNTILE=1`). That is 64 KB
per block per round and 64 KB of LDS per block. `MXCFG` prints all of it at the top of a run.

The matrix axis is also 1:1 by default (`CUMUL=1 TDMMUL=1`), so a column headed 64 launched 64 blocks.
It is a grid width either way, not a CU count: 512 is two blocks per CU on a 256-CU device.

`MWSSPAN` is the per-issuing-wave span; `LDSPART` sizes a different kernel's partition and stays at
16384, or the preflight refuses the build.

Geometry defaults (`BLKMUL`, `WTH`, `TWBLK`, `TWTH`, `RTD0N`, `RTD1N`, `RPIPEN`) live in `ualoe_bw.cpp`
alone. The sweeps used to carry a second copy in `GRID`, which quietly made a CMake build and a script
build two different programs; `GRID` is now empty unless you override something. `tools/lds_preflight.sh`
still needs its own copy to do arithmetic before anything is compiled, so it greps the source and warns
if the two have drifted.

The single-issuer fixed-tile configuration the older tables were taken with has to be asked for now:

```bash
GRID="-DMWSPIPE=2 -DMWSISS=2 -DMWSSPAN=16384" \
TDMKIND=1 DYNTILE=0 CUMUL=64 TDMMUL=32 CUS="1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256" \
bash tools/uamatrix.sh
```

Which tables need it: everything in `results/` except the `tile256x8_pipe1_iss8*` rows of
`tilegeom_gfx1250.csv`. The block sweep and matrix sections at the top of this file are single-issuer
measurements, and re-running them on the current defaults will read higher at narrow grids rather than
reproducing them. The block sweep drives its own grid widths, so for it only the `GRID`, `TDMKIND` and
`DYNTILE` part applies.

To build by hand (also 8 issuers, since that is now the file's default):

```bash
hipcc -std=c++17 -O3 --offload-arch=gfx1250 ualoe_bw.cpp -o ualoe_bw
./ualoe_bw listen  -port=55637 -gpu=0 &     # omit -gpu to use every local GPU as a pair
./ualoe_bw connect 127.0.0.1 -port=55637 -gpu=1
```

## How this gets compiled

`ualoe_bw.cpp` is built two ways on purpose, and `tools/build_ualoe.sh` is the only place that holds
the flags:

- **Through CMake**, as target `ualoe_bw` (`BUILD_BENCHMARK=ON`, and `GPU_TARGETS` has to contain a
  gfx125x or the target is skipped with a STATUS line -- the tensor-DMA builtins do not exist elsewhere).
  It builds alongside the `cco_p2p_*` benchmarks. This is what keeps the TU from silently rotting.
- **By the sweep scripts**, which call `tools/build_ualoe.sh` directly, because tile, pipe depth and
  issuer count are compile time and a sweep recompiles between configurations. They also have to run on
  a node with two idle GPUs, which is not where the package gets installed.

The flag set is `-std=c++17 -O3 --offload-arch=<gfx125x> -D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__
-DHIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`. `-O3` differs from the library's `-O2` deliberately: every table in
`results/` was measured at `-O3` and the TDM issue loop is tight enough that the two do not agree. The
two `-D`s came from the library build so that both paths speak one dialect; they change no instruction
(see Reproduction). Keep `benchmark/CMakeLists.txt` and `build_ualoe.sh` in step -- both say so in a note.

## Before changing the geometry

`tools/lds_preflight.sh` checks the LDS budget of every kernel the sweeps launch. Run it after any
change to `RTD0N`, `RTD1N`, `RPIPEN`, `LDSPART`, `MWSSPAN` or `MWSPIPE`:

```bash
RTD1N=16 bash tools/lds_preflight.sh
```

It checks two different things. The first is the 320 KB per CU limit, and exceeding that is harmless:
the launch fails with an error. The second is that each per-wave LDS partition is wide enough for the
tiles the kernel puts inside it, and that one is **silent** -- shrinking the constant shrinks the
allocation but not the addressing, so the kernel hands an out-of-range LDS offset to the TDM engine
and the process wedges in a D state that outlives `kill -9`. A node was lost that way on 2026-08-11
by raising the tile to 16 KB while leaving the partition at 16 KB, which is what the command above
reproduces as a refusal.

## Comparing numbers across runs

Only within one process. Each sweep measures all of its transports back to back in a single run for
exactly this reason: `LOOP`, build flags and clock state move the absolute numbers by more than the
differences being tested. Two tables built with different `LOOP` values are not comparable even when
they came from the same source file -- the block sweep uses `LOOP=10`, the matrix derives its
iteration count from `BUDGET`, and neither is comparable to a `LOOP=50` table.

The `config` column in `results/` carries the batch, which is why near-duplicate names exist. In
`tilegeom_gfx1250.csv`, `_full` is the 110-cell sweep the tile and issuer sections are written from,
`_pilot` is the earlier partial run at the same settings, and `_unified` is the re-measurement after the
build moved to `tools/build_ualoe.sh`. They agree to 0.07% at 16 GB, but that is a result, not a licence
to subtract rows across suffixes.

## One-operation latency

`ualoe_latency.cpp` answers the other half: not how fast a saturated link runs, but what a single
crossing costs. One thread, one outstanding operation, each op followed by the wait that matches it,
so an iteration is issue -> ack rather than an issue rate.

```bash
./ualoe_latency 0 -1        # local baseline: GPU 0 writing its own memory
./ualoe_latency 0  1        # GPU 0 -> GPU 1
# args: srcGpu  dstGpu (-1 = local)  iters  reps  stride
```

Run it twice and subtract. The local baseline is the identical loop against the issuing GPU's own
memory, so **remote minus local** is the link and cancels the cost of the instruction itself.

Eight modes, because no single one is valid on every architecture:

| mode | what it measures |
|---|---|
| `global_store_b128` / `_b32`, `flat_store`, `buffer_store` | a bare store followed by the store wait |
| `atomic_add(ret)` | a genuine round trip: the value cannot come back before the peer has answered |
| `atomic_add(noret)` | the same without the return value |
| `store+sysfence` | store plus a system-scope release |
| `store+readback` | two crossings, as a check on the others |

**The bare-store modes are only valid on gfx12.** There `s_wait_storecnt 0` is a real store counter
and retires on acknowledgement. On gfx9 the equivalent is `s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`, which retires when
the store leaves the CU -- so those four rows read the same locally and remotely and their delta is
meaningless. Use `store+sysfence` or `atomic_add` there; they agree with each other within about 1%,
and `store+readback` lands at roughly twice their delta, which is the check that they are measuring a
crossing at all.

### Two clocks

Every interval is timed with both counters at once:

- `__builtin_readcyclecounter()` counts shader clocks, which move with DVFS, so cycles are only a
  time once the clock for that run is known;
- `wall_clock64()` is the constant-rate reference clock and needs no calibration.

Their ratio has to come out as the shader clock. If it does not, one of the two is not measuring what
it is assumed to, which is the point of reporting both.

The constant clock's rate is measured against the host once per run rather than read from
`hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate`: that attribute reports 100000 kHz on gfx950 but **0 on gfx1250,
returning `hipSuccess` either way**, so dividing by it silently yields infinity.
