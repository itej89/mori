# How many blocks each transport needs to reach its ceiling on one xGMI link.
#
# CU, TDM, TDMc2 and TDMms are measured at the same block count, back to back, inside one process, so
# the curves are directly comparable. Across processes they are not: LOOP, build flags and clock state
# all move the absolute numbers by more than the differences this sweep is about.
#
# A block is not the same amount of hardware on the two sides. The CU kernel runs WTH=512 threads per
# block all moving data; the TDM kernel runs TWTH=256 threads per block of which MWSISS issue
# descriptors and the rest return immediately. Reporting per block is the point -- that asymmetry is
# what the table is meant to show.
#
# LOOP is cut from 50 to 10 because the low end of the sweep is slow. The full-grid row that BLKONLY
# prints at the end of each round is measured with the same LOOP, so it is the curve's own reference
# point rather than a number borrowed from another build.
