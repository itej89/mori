//
// 64 KB per round is the optimum, and MWSISS=8 with MWSPIPE=1 is the way to reach it that also

// K have landed":
//   store i reads the buffer load i filled, and load i is followed by 2(D-1) operations, so

// depth two leaves the reuse constraint with enormous slack and it still corrupts, so what breaks

// D=4 passing is timing slack, not semantics -- loads are local reads and stores are remote, and
